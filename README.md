# engAIge-News

engAIge News ([@engaigenews](https://twitter.com/engaigenews)) is a Twitter bot powered by natural language processing. It Tweets news articles and poses questions to consider before, during, and/or after reading. This bot was heavily moderated during its existence. Due to concerns over negligent or malicious repurposing of the source code, I have elected not to display it publicly. For serious inquiries, please contact me at alawton6@gatech.edu.
